# SPM Blocks of Wisdom Mod
A simple mod I made for fun that ended up being a hell of a lot cooler than I originally thought it'd be. Throwable blocks are quite broken - with the correct uses, you can gain extra height, clip through any wall, and deal "damage" to any NPC (even if they don't have HP, lololol)

Please report any bugs that you experience to me on Discord - @tartt

## Controls
Blocks may only be spawned while you're able to move. You can have up to 5 blocks in a room at once. Every time a BoW action is performed, there will be a 60 frame delay before the next one may occur. BoW actions may be buffered, but no other buttons may be held in order for these to activate.

* **B-Up** spawns a throwable block directly over the player. This hotkey will do nothing when you have 5 in a room.

* **B-Down** clears all active blocks.

## Upcoming Features
* Hotkey to change the orientation of blocks to spawn in Mario's facing direction OR directly above Mario **(B-Right)**
* Hotkey to change the type of block Mario spawns (Throwable, Coin, maybe others)
* Text display at the bottom-left of the screen that updates when you've spawned a block, how many you have remaining, how blocks will spawn, current block type, etc.
